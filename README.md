##  Gameplay :boom:
The basic gameplay elements of this game are:
-   territories, possessions, domiciles, loved ones (or collectively the "base") that must be defended by the player.
-   waves of multiple incoming "enemies" that must be defended against
-   placement of "tower" elements, such as towers, or obstructions along the path of attacking enemies.
What distinguishes this game from other base defending games (such as Space Invaders, or other games where bases are defended) is the player's ability to strategically place, construct, upgrade or summon obstructive constructions and constructive obstructions in the path of attacking enemies.

In a tower defense, unlike the base, the player's main character is often invincible, as the primary object is the survival of the base rather than the player.

**Some features of this game:**
-   Player placed obstructions that can damage or kill enemy attackers before the obstructions destroy the base
-   Ability to sell obstructions
-   Ability to upgrade obstructions
- There are four type of defensive buildings in total.
-   Some sort of currency with which to purchase upgrades and repairs  are in-game money, and it is being earned by the defeat of an attacking.
-   Enemies capable of traversing multiple paths at once
-   Each wave has a set number and types of enemies
- There are four types of hostile enemies that may attack your base. 
- There are three different levels in this game, each one being increased in difficulty.
